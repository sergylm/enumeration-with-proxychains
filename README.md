# Multi-threaded Port and Service Scanner with Proxychains and Nmap

This script is a powerful tool for network reconnaissance, combining the versatility of nmap with proxychains for enhanced anonymity. It supports:
- Top Ports Scanning: Quickly scan the most common ports or all ports (with -p-) by setting top_ports to 0.
- Service Detection: Identify services running on open ports for a detailed network profile.
- Multithreading: Perform scans in parallel, speeding up the process for large lists of IPs.
- Custom Configuration: Easily configure proxychains and threading through script arguments.

Designed for efficiency and precision, this script is ideal for network engineers, penetration testers, or anyone exploring network security.
